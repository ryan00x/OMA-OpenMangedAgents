# Fleet & Advanced Features

Open Managed Agents is built to run multi-agent workloads, orchestrate a fleet of parallel sessions, monitor long-running tasks, and safely isolate untrusted runtimes.

## 1. Pick a Sandbox Backend per Environment

Environments — the reusable configurations defining package managers, system packages, and network permissions — can map to their own specific sandbox provider. This allows you to mix isolation levels dynamically on the same host:
* Run trusted internal scripts on fast, cheap **Host Subprocess** isolation.
* Route customer-facing code execution to highly secure, hardware-isolated **E2B**, **Daytona**, or **BoxLite (Firecracker)** micro-VMs.

```json
// Environment config referencing a custom provider
{
  "name": "data-analyst",
  "config": {
    "sandbox_provider": "my-daytona-prod",
    "packages": {
      "pip": ["numpy", "pandas"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Supported Sandbox Providers

| Provider | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `subprocess` | Host Subprocess | Plain OS subprocess. Extremely fast, default for local development. |
| `k8s` | Kubernetes | Pod isolation managed via Kubernetes agent-sandbox controller. |
| `e2b` | E2B Sandbox | Sandbox hosting on E2B. Requires `E2B_API_KEY`. |
| `daytona` | Daytona VM | VM hosting on Daytona. Requires `DAYTONA_API_KEY`. |
| `litebox` | BoxLite Local | Local Firecracker micro-VM for local hardware isolation. |
| `boxrun` | BoxLite Remote | Remote BoxLite HTTP control plane for micro-VM orchestration. |
| `openshell` | NVIDIA OpenShell | Policy-enforced, isolated agent sandboxes driven by an OpenShell gateway (gRPC). Requires `OPENSHELL_GATEWAY_ENDPOINT`. |

### API Endpoints
* **List hosting types**: `GET /v1/hosting_types` returns all registered local and BYOK providers. Each provider's `health` now carries an optional `capacity` (`cpu` / `memory` / `pods` used-vs-total) surfaced best-effort from the adapter — the console Runtimes page renders these as live gauges with 30s auto-refresh.
* **Register custom provider**: `POST /v1/sandbox_providers` to register external sandbox endpoints.

## 2. Session Fleet Kanban Board

Monitor the state of all active sessions across your agent fleet. The status board maps sessions into four status columns derived entirely from existing metadata:

1. **Queued**: An idle session with no events processed yet.
2. **Running**: A session currently driving the loop or executing tools.
3. **Blocked**: An idle session waiting on tool execution confirmation (`requires_action` event).
4. **Done**: A completed session or one that returned to idle without errors.

Because the board is derived directly from the SQLite event log, there is no extra backend database state to sync.

---

## 3. Parallel Sub-Agent Delegation

The default delegation tool `call_agent_*` blocks the parent session until the child reaches `idle`.
The `call_agents_parallel` tool allows parent agents to fan out concurrent child requests and aggregate results in parallel.

### Usage Example
Input tool call:
```json
{
  "calls": [
    { "agent_id": "agent_researcher", "message": "Research topic A" },
    { "agent_id": "agent_researcher", "message": "Research topic B" },
    { "agent_id": "agent_writer", "message": "Draft outline C" }
  ]
}
```

Aggregated response output:
```json
{
  "results": [
    { "agent_id": "agent_researcher", "success": true, "response": "...", "thread_id": "sthr_123" },
    { "agent_id": "agent_researcher", "success": true, "response": "...", "thread_id": "sthr_456" },
    { "agent_id": "agent_writer", "success": false, "error": "Sub-agent error: compile failed" }
  ]
}
```

> [!NOTE]
> Concurrency is configured via the agent's `max_parallel_subagents` field (default is 5, hard ceiling is 10). Excess requests are queued in waves automatically.

---

## 4. Structured Progress for Long-Running Tasks

For tasks that run for minutes or hours, standard text messages are hard to parse. The `agent.status` event sends structured heartbeats directly from the loop controller:

```json
{
  "type": "agent.status",
  "state": "running",
  "summary": "Executing scikit-learn training...",
  "step": 14,
  "total_steps": 20,
  "blocked_on": null
}
```

* **Heartbeat interval**: Fires on every model turn. The `long-running` harness fires wall-clock heartbeats (default every 60s) to indicate liveness during slow tool runs.
* **Cache optimization**: These heartbeats are stored in the Durable Object log but excluded from prompt context history. This avoids polluting prompt-cache keys or triggering premature token compaction.
* **Crash recovery**: Re-instantiating the session DO automatically parses the log and catches up step counters without duplicates.

---

## 5. Outbound Notification Dispatcher

Agents can post status transitions (e.g. session done, error, blocked) to external communication channels. Add the `notify` field to your agent configuration:

```json
{
  "name": "CI Reviewer",
  "notify": [
    {
      "type": "github_comment",
      "credential_id": "cred_gh",
      "owner": "duyet",
      "repo": "oma",
      "issue_number": 52
    },
    {
      "type": "slack_message",
      "credential_id": "cred_slack",
      "channel": "C0123456"
    },
    {
      "type": "matrix_message",
      "credential_id": "cred_matrix",
      "homeserver_url": "https://matrix.org",
      "room_id": "!abc:matrix.org"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Formatting Styles
* **GitHub**: Posted as markdown comments with a status indicator dot (🔴 Error, ⚪ Blocked, 🟢 Success).
* **Slack**: Formatted using Slack mrkdwn and emoji blocks.
* **Matrix**: Sent via Matrix Client-Server API room messages.
